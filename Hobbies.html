<h2>Pouncing</h2>
<p>Cats love to pounce. It’s a good way to hone their already sharp hunting skills, and perfect for someone with a rodent problem.<br>They’ll pounce on toys, shiny things, balls, toes, their tails, and even things that us mere humans can’t see.</p>

<h2>Sunning</h2>
<p>A favorite hobby amongst our feline friends is to find a nice warm spot of sunlight and sprawl in it, soaking up the rays.<br>This can be anywhere in the house, often right in the middle of the walkway.<br>But it’s okay, they understand and will let you walk around them. And when there’s no sun?<br>Don't worry, they’ll snuggle up against something warm, like the heater, or you.</p>

<h2>People watching</h2>
<p>Cats love to observe the world as it passes by.<br>They love to perch on a windowsill and just watch. Sometimes commenting with a meow here and there.<br>Some cats have fans who visit them regularly. This is okay. Your cat will still love you most.<br>But really, who doesn't appreciate a bevy of admirers?</p>

<h2>Stalking</h2>
<p>Not the kind of stalking that gets humans into so much trouble, cats find that demeaning.<br>No, the cat version of stalking is much more noble and is entrenched in their hunting skills.<br>Cats will stalk toys, string, laser lights, anything that you use to play with them.<br>Plus, it gives them the daily workout they need to keep themselves looking so good.</p>

<h2>Eating</h2>
<p> Part of looking good for any cat is diet. They love to eat. The better the quality of the diet, the better the cat looks.<br>Raw food diets and high quality wet food that’s meal and by-product free is the best. Just don’t overfeed,<br>as your cat doesn’t want to be a fat cat, just a sleek one.</p>

<h2>Sleeping</h2>
<p>Quite possibly a cat’s favorite hobby.<br>Sleeping not only helps her always have enough energy for a sudden trek in the wild, hunting random wild animals (or human legs), <br>and toys … it gives her that extra kitty glow we all love so much.
    <br>
<br>
    As you can see, with just the right amount of human interaction, a cat is more than able to entertain herself.<br>Of course, never neglect your cat, because like the rest of us, they need love and attention.
    <br>
    As to what a cat gets up to when you’re not around.<br>Well, that’s one hobby they all refuse to divulge.
    <br>

    Meow! It’s Monday.
