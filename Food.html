    <h2>Meat</h2>
    <p>Cats are meat eaters, plain and simple. They have to have protein from meat for a strong heart, good vision, and a healthy reproductive system.<br>Cooked beef, chicken, turkey, and small amounts of lean deli meats are a great way to give them that.<br>Raw or spoiled meat could make your cat sick. If you wouldn't eat it, don't give it to your pet.</p>

    <h2>Whole grains</h2>
    <p>Oats have a lot of protein per calorie, and they're easy to make. Many cats like corn, and polenta, a coarsely ground cornmeal, has a good texture for them.<br>You can try brown rice, barley, and wheat berries, but you may need to mash them first.<br>Cats tend to like smaller grains like millet and couscous. Just make sure any grains you give are cooked so your kitty can digest them fully.<br>Whole wheat breadcrumbs are OK, too.</p>

    <h2>Fish</h2>
    <p>Fish have a lot of omega-3 fatty acids, which help your cat's eyes stay sharp as well as help with arthritis, kidney disease, and heart disorders.<br>Canned or cooked fish is fine for a treat. But don't share your shashimi or sushi with raw fish. Raw fish in general isn't a good idea.</p>

    <h2>Eggs</h2>
    <p>Eggs are another super source of protein for your cat. But make sure they're cooked. Like raw meat and fish, raw eggs can harm your kitty.</p>

    <h2>Veggies</h2>
    <p>Not all cats like vegetables, and even fewer like fruits (felines can't taste sweet flavors).<br>But they are a rich source of vitamins, and they're loaded with fiber and water to help with digestion.<br>Try fresh cucumber or cantaloupe, steamed broccoli, or asparagus.<br>But you might have better luck slipping them a veggie burger -- really -- just be careful the patty doesn't include onions or garlic.</p>

    <h2>Foods cats shouldn't eat</h2>
    <p>Steer clear of these foods when sharing your snacks. They're toxic to cats:
<br>
<br>
<ul>These are toxic to cats:
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Grapes and raisins</li> 
        <li>Onions and garlic</li>
        <li>Macadamia nuts</li> 
        <li>Bread dough</li> 
        <li>Alcohol</li> 
        <li>Xylitol (an artificial sweetener found in sugar-free gum and candy)</li>
    </ul>
        <br>
    Don't let curiosity, well, you know. Keep foods not meant for your cat in a place they can't get to them.</p>
